# Space Guardians (Aquinta Mix)

Space Guardians is a Arcadians (BBC, 1983) clone that was written for the final project of the bootcamp at northcoders. 
This remix has taken the game out of the react front end and uses a LocalStorage for the high score table. 
I have also tweaked various elements and am looking to further alter the game moving forward, including a longer music track; moving enemies, and joypad functionality.

## Installation 

Simply clone the repository to your computer and use a live server to play the game in your browser. Also available to play at - https://main--spaceguardians.netlify.app/

## Usage

Once the game is up and running everything is explaned, as you can see here -

## The Game itself

You are in a high score battle with you and your friends, as the last Space Guardian left in the fight against the evil Arcadians!

### How to delete your local high score table

Open the developer inpector in your browser, head to applications, and find local storage where you will see the 'localhighscores' object. Simply delete it and you will have a fresh high score table. Do this at your peril as the scores will be gone forever!

## Contributing

I am open to any and all suggestions for improvements, beyond what I have listed above. It is my hope to eventually have a full clone of Arcadians, but as a first time out I am still happy with what we have.
